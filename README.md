# Mini-Project-Last-Year

Digit recognition system is the working of a machine to train itself or recognizing
the digits from different sources like emails, bank cheque, papers, images, etc. and in
different real-world scenarios for online handwriting recognition on computer tablets
or system, recognize number plates of vehicles, processing bank cheque amounts,
numeric entries in forms filled up by hand (say â€” tax forms,receipts) and so on. Our
goal is to create a system which detects numbers from images based on previously
learned datasets.
